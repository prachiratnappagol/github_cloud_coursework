Document creation using REST API with CRUD operations,node.js and Firebase database

INTRODUCTION:
In this project we created a REST API that will handle request and return a response .
We created an application “Document Creation” for various users that contains their information.

Additional Features :
Used parameter passing in the request.
For security purpose we have used origin as true,so that no one else can access our application through another URL.
Used status codes for the requests made by clients.

Tools Used:
Firebase Database 
Node js (Application development )
Postman has been installed to test our API
Visual Code Editor for editing the code 

Overview:
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, and back-end JavaScript runtime environment
Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Rest API:
An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. 
It is a way of creating, getting ,modifying, and deleting information for the user. 
Postman has been installed to test our API
We have used firebase database to initialize functions and libraries

CRUD Operations :
Create - It is used to retrieve resource representation/information with no modifications. As ‘GET’ requests do not change the resource’s state
Read - The read function is similar to a search function. It allows users to search and retrieve specific records in the table and read their values
Update -  The update function is used to modify existing records that exist in the database. To fully change a record, users may have to modify information in multiple fields
Delete - The delete function allows users to remove records from a database that is no longer needed 

Firebase database:
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Google’s infrastructure.
Firebase is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSON-like documents.

1. Authentication - It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. The Firebase Authentication (SDK) can be used to manually integrate one or more sign-in methods into an app.
2. Realtime database-Data is synced across all clients in realtime and remains available even when an app goes offline.
3. Hosting-Firebase Hosting provides fast hosting for a web app; content is cached into content delivery networks worldwide.
4. Test lab-The application is tested on virtual and physical devices located in Google’s data centers.
5. Notifications-Notifications can be sent with firebase with no additional coding.Users can get started with firebase for free
